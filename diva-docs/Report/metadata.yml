    ======================
    
    Hundreds of thousands of patients report unwanted symptoms from using one or more drugs each year. 
    It is virtually impossible to test every drug combination before a drug reaches the market. In this 
    project, we reimplement and integrate two previously proposed tools to mine and visualize interesting 
    pairs of drugs from report data, focusing on creating a single web application that is functional and 
    maintainable. Furthermore, we research and implement new features including drug and reaction name 
    standardization. Upon finishing development, we conduct a user study and technical evaluation to ensure 
    our system meets the requirements and improve usability. Based on the results of our studies, we improve 
    the usability and identify areas that require further attention.

    ==============================
    
    This project would not have been possible without the help of our faculty
    advisor, Prof. Elke Rundensteiner, and our graduate student mentors, Tabassum
    Kakar and Xiao Qin. They provided extensive guidance and feedback throughout our development
    efforts. Additionally, we would like to thank Prof. Lane Harrison for his guidance, especially
    with the data visualization and user evaluation aspects of the project.
    We are thankful to Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the Computer Science department
    for providing us with the opportunity to work on this project.

    We would also like to thank Ermal Toto and the WPI ARC for providing the
    computational resources to host our application on the web, facilitating testing and evaluation.

    Finally, we would like to thank the FDA for their assistance in establishing
    requirements for our project and providing some (redacted) data essential for demonstrating the capabilities of our project.

    Executive Summary {.unnumbered}
    ===============================
    
    Every year, more than 100,000 deaths and 2 million hospitalizations are 
    caused by the side effects of prescription drugs or the unintended 
    interactions from taking multiple drugs simultaneously. These adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the leading 
    causes of death worldwide. While extensive clinical trials are conducted to identify the ADRs associated with 
    a single drug before that drug reaches the market, it is virtually impossible to test how a drug will interact with every other 
    drug or combination of drugs. Therefore, multi-drug adverse reactions (MDARs) are identified primarily after the drug 
    reaches the market. Healthcare professionals and consumers are encouraged to submit reports through the FDA’s Adverse Event 
    Reporting System (FAERS) in the event that they witness or experience what they believe may be an ADR. Safety evaluators with 
    the FDA then analyze these reports to identify groups of drugs that cause an adverse reaction when taken together. To assist FDA 
    safety evaluators with their goal of identifying MDARs, Xiao Qin and Tabassum Kakar developed the Multi-Drug Adverse Reaction 
    Analytics Strategy (MARAS) system and also designed a visual paradigm, which they called Drug-Drug Interactions via Visual Analysis (DIVA).
    These systems harness association rule 
    mining to identify potential MDARs from FAERS reports and provide an interactive visualization of the 2-drug rules mined by MARAS, 
    respectively.

    The goal of our project was to develop a minimum viable product to demonstrate how Kakar and Qin’s work could be used to assist 
    FDA safety evaluators. To do this, we unified the MARAS and DIVA systems into a single application, the Multi-drug Interaction 
    Analytics Platform (MIAP). While developing MIAP, we completely reimplemented the MARAS and DIVA systems to facilitate their unification 
    into one system and their future maintainability. Throughout the process, we improved the MARAS technology by adding smarter drug name and 
    adverse reaction processing. We also improved the DIVA system by increasing visual appeal and overall usability. Finally, we conducted 
    a usability evaluation to test how MIAP matched up against the requirements specified by Kakar and Qin’s cooperative research with the 
    FDA and highlight areas that could use improvement.

    Currently, FDA safety analysts are confronted with the challenge of sifting through millions of new reports each year in search of MDARs. 
    For now, these personnel are approaching this task without the support of software for mining potential interactions, visualization of 
    these interactions, or the screening of potential interactions based on confidence scores or association with severe adverse reactions. 
    This means that safety analysts have to spend time scanning through reports before prioritizing potential drug combinations for further 
    investigation. Then, when they have prioritized the drug combinations of interest, they must retrieve all reports related to each drug 
    combination before applying domain knowledge to determine how to proceed with a clinical investigation or potential drug regulation.

    With the assistance of MIAP, the prioritization of potential MDARs and subsequent analysis of those MDARs is simplified. Filters can be 
    applied to the visualization to look at the MDARs with the highest confidence scores. These drugs can then be sorted by the severity 
    of the associated adverse reactions. Then, all of the reports associated with the drug or hypothesized MDAR can be retrieved with the 
    click of a button.

    While much of the functionality of MIAP was previously available in the MARAS and DIVA systems, there are several notable improvements. 
    The previous MARAS system was composed of multiple programming languages, lacked documentation, and did not take full advantage of 
    Object-Oriented programming concepts. Additionally, MARAS did not perform any cleaning on drug names or adverse reaction names, and did 
    not label mined rules as known or unknown. Meanwhile, the previous DIVA system also lacked sufficient documentation and was completely 
    separate from the MARAS system. Thus it required manual intervention to move files between the two systems.

    As a result of this project, the new MARAS system was reimplemented using just one programming language and taking advantage of encapsulation 
    and object generation. Additionally, javadoc-style documentation was used to provide internal and external guidance on the use of the system. 
    MARAS now performs cleaning on drug names and adverse reactions to assist in the rule mining and known-rule labeling processes. The DIVA 
    system also underwent a complete reimplementation, separating each feature into its own component file and adding javadoc-style comments for future 
    developers. Finally, MIAP unifies MARAS and DIVA, meaning that no manual intervention is required to go between the user interface for 
    visualization and the rule mining process, and vice versa.

    With the addition of these new features, users can now upload FAERS data via the user interface, automatically starting the MARAS analysis 
    on the new data combined with all previously uploaded data. Then, when the MARAS analysis finishes, the users’ visualization will be updated 
    automatically. With improved usability aspects, it will be easier than ever to prioritize and analyze MDARs. Lastly, with refactored code and 
    extensive documentation, future developers will be able to more easily contribute to this project. This project will serve as a better 
    model should the FDA choose to adopt a similar application in support of their drug safety investigation.

    Upon completion of this project, we have developed a list of recommendations for improvements that can be made to MIAP in the future. These 
    recommendations are as follows:

    1. Add a database to store reports and rules in order to decrease the time of retrieving information about specific reports or drugs.

    2. Improve the usability of the Reports View and add annotation functionality to allow FDA safety analysts the ability to give domain insight directly within our tool.

    3. Allow for the visualization of custom datasets or a subset of the existing dataset, as we currently have chosen to support only appending new data from FAERS into our tool.

    4. Conduct an evaluation with FDA personnel to ensure MIAP meets their needs, receive additional suggestions, and determine whether they agree 
    with the metaphors currently employed in MIAP.
