@article{Li2007,
abstract = {Mining frequent patterns is an important data mining task and has been widely studied. However, the traditional frequent pattern mining does not involve the ordered problem, which is widely exists in the real world. A lot of papers have been proposed to solve the ordered problem, including sequential pattern mining, item sequences mining, temporal feature extraction, web log study and ordered patterns mining. Most of these papers used an APRIORI-based algorithm hence did not adopt the wonderful ideas and advanced technologies in traditional frequent patterns mining. This paper introduced a data structure called FOP-tree which is a modified version of FP-tree to solve the ordered patterns mining. The performance study shows that the FOP-tree is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent ordered patterns, and is much faster than the traditional APRIORI-bases algorithms on several situations.},

@article{Kuhn2016,
abstract = {Unwanted side effects of drugs are a burden on patients and a severe impediment in the development of new drugs. At the same time, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) recorded during clinical trials are an important source of human phenotypic data. It is therefore essential to combine data on drugs, targets and side effects into a more complete picture of the therapeutic mechanism of actions of drugs and the ways in which they cause adverse reactions. To this end, we have created the SIDER ('Side Effect Resource', http://sideeffects.embl.de) database of drugs and ADRs. The current release, SIDER 4, contains data on 1430 drugs, 5880 ADRs and 140 064 drug-ADR pairs, which is an increase of 40{\%} compared to the previous version. For more fine-grained analyses, we extracted the frequency with which side effects occur from the package inserts. This information is available for 39{\%} of drug-ADR pairs, 19{\%} of which can be compared to the frequency under placebo treatment. SIDER furthermore contains a data set of drug indications, extracted from the package inserts using Natural Language Processing. These drug indications are used to reduce the rate of false positives by identifying medical terms that do not correspond to ADRs.},

This study reports on MetaMap's evolution over more than a decade, concentrating on those features arising out of the research needs of the biomedical informatics community both within and outside of the National Library of Medicine. Such features include the detection of author-defined acronyms/abbreviations, the ability to browse the Metathesaurus for concepts even tenuously related to input text, the detection of negation in situations in which the polarity of predications is important, word sense disambiguation (WSD), and various technical and algorithmic features. Near-term plans for MetaMap development include the incorporation of chemical name recognition and enhanced WSD.},

abstract="Customer value determines how products and services succeed in the marketplace. Early assessment of customer value is important for software startups, spin-off companies, and new product development in existing companies. Software technology often influences customer value and typically defines the main competitive advantage in both entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial settings. Value-related feedback from real customers is needed during software development and maintenance, and decision-making should be increasingly based on empirical evidence acquired through experiments. Getting such value-related feedback usually requires a so-called minimum viable product (MVP), i.e., an artefact that may be incomplete in functionality or quality, but displays characteristics that allows determining its customer value. In this article we report on a case study which used industry-academia collaboration for creating such an MVP. Our goal was to identify strengths and weaknesses of such an approach to creating MVPs while providing practical recommendations for improvement. The process followed in the case study was found to be very suitable for creating MVPs, reducing company-specific risks when testing customer-value, and advancing university education.",
